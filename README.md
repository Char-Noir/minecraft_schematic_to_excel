# Have you ever built anything in minecraft?

Probably so. But you always want to develop. As in other branches of art - you copy other people's works and develop. Maybe you just want to show off your construction skills to your friends.

But there are only schematics on the website of the models. And you can watch it only in the game. It is not very convenient to build something while switching between game tabs.

Then this tool is for you.

# Present:

So far, in this version, it allows you to convert schematics of only one site into a convenient Excel file.

Each sheet of the file represents one of the layers of the building. Each block has an image that represents the block itself and its blockstate. And very important for those who build in survival mode: the number of each block required for construction.

# Future:

- Full support of schematics is planned;
- Texture generator for Excel to reduce the volume of the project
- The ability to view the model in the 3D world with low PC load.

PS. This is only a prototype, so it only works on a limited piece of data that has been tested.
At the moment, we are developing a complete tool for interacting with schematics from the game.
